# MongoDB Clojure Driver Documentation

This is a documentation site for [monger, an idiomatic Clojure MongoDB client](https://github.com/michaelklishin/monger).


## How to regenerate the site

In order to modify contents and launch dev environment, switch to Ruby 1.8.7 (JRuby and Rubinius in 1.8 mode also work fine) and run:

      jekyll

In order to recompile haml and sass files for publishing, run

      ./recompile_haml.sh
